# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
for the **0.x** experimental line (breaking on-disk and API changes are expected
before 1.0).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Electrum `get_balance`:** unconfirmed delta uses the mempool scripthash
  index instead of store-resolving every live chain input. Empty Cake keys were
  ~1.5 s each on a mainnet mempool.

### Changed

- **Electrum `server.version`:** first element is `rbitcoin-electrs <ver>` so
  Cake Wallet’s `getNodeIsElectrs()` will probe `blockchain.tweaks.subscribe`.
  Current Cake scan isolate still hardcodes `electrs.cakewallet.com`.

- **CLI-first config:** `--maxinbound`/`--maxconnections`, `--archive-queue-mb`,
  `--conf`, Core-like aliases (`--assumevalid-height`, `--maxmempool`, `--chain`).
  Explicit CLI/conf knobs publish to env; omitting them **preserves** advanced
  `RBITCOIN_*` exports. Normal sync does not require any env export.
- **Tip-follow logging:** every accepted tip block logs Core-like `UpdateTip: …`
  (IBD keeps periodic progress/perf lines only).
- **Docs hygiene:** removed abandoned plans/forensics notes from the release
  surface; COMPAT documents BIP324 short-ID live-set vs deferred Core IDs.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-26

### Experimental first public packaging

Initial **0.x** packaging of an experimental Bitcoin full node in Rust:

- Multi-peer IBD and tip follow over **BIP324 v2-only** P2P
- Relational Class A/B/C archive (reconstruct historical blocks; tip wire ring + tip durability after catch-up; store later fully map-free — see `docs/io-modality.md`)
- **Pure-Rust** consensus/script path (secp256k1 via rust-bitcoin only; no libbitcoinconsensus dual-eval)
- Confirm pipeline (load / scripts / write), Direct index mode during IBD, native scripthash + in-process **Electrum** after tip
- Libre-class mempool admission with script checks on accept; BIP152 v2 compact blocks and BIP339 wtxid relay on tip sessions
- Operator docs for **signet lab first** and **experimental mainnet** (default milestone skips scripts ≤ 840000)

### Documentation

- Architecture overview for unique store / IO / consensus design (`docs/architecture.md`)
- Security policy (`SECURITY.md`), this changelog, dual MIT OR Apache-2.0 licenses

### Notes

- On-disk schema is **unstable until 1.0** (reindex on incompatible changes).
- Completing a full mainnet IBD on an operator host is **out of band** for this
  release packaging; experimental mainnet remains lab-only.
- Workspace package metadata does not claim a public `repository` URL until one
  is published.
